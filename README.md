# C++ Hangman
Classic hangman game where the user is shown blanks representing letter of a word and then tries to guess and fill in the letters with a limited number of guesses.
## Description
Project started as a way to enhance C++ skills. As I learned more, I was able to manipulate C-String variables (variables of type char*), Pass C-Strings to functions and utilize the C-String library `#include <cstring>` to perform various string operations.
## Features
* Allows 10 incorrect guesses per game
* Placeholders for yet unguessed letters
* Keeps track of guessed letters
